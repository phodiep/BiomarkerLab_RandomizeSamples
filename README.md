BiomarkerLab_RandomizeSamples
=============================

List of samples is imported via csv, list is then randomized and exported as "file_randomized.csv".

All columns in CSV file are left entact.

No header is necessary in csv file, or it will be treated as a "sample" and randomized along with other samples.
